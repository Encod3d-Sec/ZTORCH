# Scaffolds targets/<name>/ with the type-aware file set + ingest/ poc/ dirs,
# and points targets/active.md at it. Engagement data stays under targets/ (private).
#   - pentest/bugbounty: full set (adds oob.md, Vuln-index.md, identities/source-ledger/
#     write-ledger campaign-driver files).
#   - ctf: lean set (state,loot,Approach,scope,Deadends); Killchain.md/log.md are
#     pentest/bugbounty-only (a ctf's live chain lives in state.md's ## Chain/## Status
#     sections instead); walkthrough.md/eval.md self-create on demand at their trigger
#     (close-out.py / Skill(learn)) for every type, same as decisions.md (/redteamlead);
#     oob is opt-in via --with-oob; the severity Vuln-index is skipped (a slim ctf
#     findings list is created on demand by ensure_optional_file). Per-asset coverage
#     lives in the Approach.md 4a table for all types.
#   - --scope <host> (repeatable): seed scope.md's "## In scope" bullets at creation
#     time, so scope-gated evidence auto-capture is live immediately instead of
#     waiting on a hand-edit. Validated against a conservative host/CIDR charset;
#     an invalid value is skipped (creation still succeeds), never written to disk.
# Vulns/ is NOT created here; it is made lazily on the first FIND (pentest/bugbounty).
# Keep the file set in sync with SHARED_CORE/SHARED_FULL/STATE_DIRS in
# skills/hooks/_engagement.py, which self-heals the same set at SessionStart.
