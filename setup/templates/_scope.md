#   In scope             - hosts / domains / CIDRs you are authorised to test, one per line.
#   Out of scope          - explicit exclusions; matched against state entities and suppressed.
#   Allowed tooling        - what you may run; note bans e.g. no automated scanners, no exploit, passive-only.
#   Rules of engagement    - hours, rate limits, notification, contract constraints.
