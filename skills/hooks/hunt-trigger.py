"""UserPromptSubmit hook: auto-fire hunt skills + fire telemetry.

Matches the user prompt against skills/hunt/triggers.json in two tiers and
ROUTES to the relevant skill (surfaces it as a suggestion); the skill itself
carries the methodology mandate, not this hook. Stdout is added to the context.

  - "triggers"         explicit vuln-type keywords -> HIGH confidence.
                       Surface the skill as the relevant one to load.
  - "surface_triggers" natural attack-surface terms (login form, upload field,
                       api endpoint, ...) -> heuristic. Emit a softer "consider"
                       line, escapable when the prompt is not about testing.

De-noise: on a fire we emit ONLY the directive, not the engagement summary
(SessionStart already shows that once) so the action item is not buried.

Telemetry: every prompt (fire or miss) appends one leak-safe record to
<vault>/.trigger-fire.jsonl -- NO prompt text, only ts + fired skills + length.
scripts/trigger-stats.py reads it to measure match rate and tune triggers.json.

Non-fatal: any error exits 0 silent so a broken hook never blocks a prompt.
