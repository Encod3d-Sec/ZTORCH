"""Stop hook: close-out reflex. When the active engagement is marked SOLVED but its
web evidence is incomplete (a web box with no recon cards or no saved render+source) --
or the walkthrough is not assembled -- or the walkthrough is done but the learn harvest is
still due -- surface a one-line nudge to run the close-out steps. The web-evidence gate
fires FIRST: you cannot have a complete walkthrough without the evidence, and it is the
thing skipped under momentum (recon cards, site render+source).

This is the reflex the de-bloat left unwired: deleting loop-driver removed the Stop-gate,
and _engagement.is_solved / walkthrough_stale / learn_pending had no caller, so a SOLVED box
produced no reminder (observed live: a solved box whose walkthrough + learn were never
invoked). Advisory + fail-open: never blocks the Stop, prints nothing on any
error, and self-clears the moment the walkthrough is assembled and Skill(learn) writes
.learn-done.
