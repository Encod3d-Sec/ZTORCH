"""Canonical expected vault-hook set + drift detector (hooks AND skills).

Single source of truth for which vault hooks SHOULD be registered in this
machine's ~/.claude/settings.json. settings.json is machine-local and does not
sync across devices, so a hook can silently go unregistered on one machine
(hooks fail open + silent, so the omission is invisible). This module lets the
SessionStart hook surface that drift as one advisory line.

When you add a new vault hook to setup/install-hooks.sh, also add it to
EXPECTED_HOOKS below so the drift check stays accurate on every device.

missing_hooks() returns the script basenames that the expected set requires but
that are absent from settings.json. It fails open: an unreadable or missing
settings.json returns [] (we cannot assert drift without the file).

missing_skills() does the parallel check for skills: setup/install-skills.sh
symlinks every SKILL.md-bearing dir under skills/ into ~/.claude/skills so the
Skill tool + /skills picker can load it. That dest is also machine-local and the
installer is only re-run by hand, so a newly added vault skill can sit
unregistered (Skill(<name>) -> "Unknown skill") while triggers.json still routes
to it. No EXPECTED list to maintain: the SKILL.md walk IS the source of truth,
identical to the installer's `find skills -name SKILL.md`.
